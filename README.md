# Smart Detector of Depressive Disorder

An Intelligent depression detector


## Motivation

In the world there are more than 280 million people diagnosed with depression. If you add them all together, it would be the fourth most populated country in the world. Today, access to quality mental health diagnosis and follow-up is taboo and difficult to access. The idea is to be able to create a therapeutic assistant that not only detects depression, but also supports the process of improvement.


## Method

In order to achieve this, and following the line of several researchers,  we have made a neural network that we trained with a database (Avec2017) of transcripts of therapy sessions of diagnosed people and people without depression. I am currently working on incorporating audio.


## More resources

I am currently testing a RandomForest model and an SVC model, and will try a neural network soon.

## About

This project was done for the final project of Le Wagon's Data Science bootcamp delivered on March 18, with the help of my teammates Daniel Riojas, Lucas Pancotto and Leonardo Asad and is currently being updated.
